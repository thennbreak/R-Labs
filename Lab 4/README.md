Poisson Distribution:
A soft introduction to poisson distribution and probability mass function (PMF).

Definitions:
  - Probability Mass Function (PMF): Probability over a discrete set of outcomes, which can be represented as a table or displayed as a historgram
  - Poisson PMF: Do not know how many times an experiment will be performed but the average is known on how many times you get lambda
    - Lambda is the mean rate for occurrence of an "event" or "success"
