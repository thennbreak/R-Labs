In lab 1 I will be doing a non-parametric bootstrap on a set of data and then finding the one-sided upper and lower bound, as well as, the twosided confidence interval of the generated data.


The set of data was given and is a sample of 10 methamphetamine mass measurements done by a forensics lab:
  (49.9996,49.9994,49.9993, 
      49.9996,49.9995,49.9995, 
      49.9995,49.9994,49.9995, 
      49.9994)
In this case, set set of data is stored in x and will be called the sample of data.
The new samples generated by the bootstrap will be x* and will be called the resamples.
    - for each resample the statistic of interest will need to be calculated which is done automatically in R (theta*)
    - the resample set of data will be called B theta* and named the bootstrap approximation for the sampling distribution of theta

The bootstrap performed will randomly generate 2,000 more resamples.
